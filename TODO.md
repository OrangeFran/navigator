# Things to do in the (near) feature

### Small fixes

- ✅  ~~Do not allow scrolling over files you don't see (appears when searching for files).~~ 

### Plans

- ✅  ~~Add live search. It updates while searching so you find your stuff better.~~

- Display some information about the stuff in the current folder, like size etc.
- More configuration options.
- Allow searching with regex.
